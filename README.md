## Setup
SonarCloud:
  - setup account with SonarCloud with Github
  - import your organization and repository within SonarCloud
  - click branch and setup CI
  - setup sonarcloud secret
  - add properties tag to the .pom file in the backend, don't forget to push the changes
  - setup new github action workflow, paste code given by sonarcloud into /.github/workflows/build.yml


## Instruction
**Backend: This project is the backend for a loan application system for banks. It provides a RESTful API for creating, updating, and accessing loan application data. The API is built using Node.js, and uses a PostgreSQL database to store loan application data.**
  - Before you can install and run the backend, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:
    - Node.js (version 12 or later)
    - PostgreSQL (version 12 or later)
      ## **Installation**
        - Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ALoan-Banks/backend.git
        - Navigate to the project directory: cd backend
        - Install the dependencies: npm install
        - Set up a local PostgreSQL database and configure the database connection settings in the .env file. You will need to create a database and a user with permissions to access it.
        - Run the database migration script to set up the necessary tables: npm run migrate
        - Run the seed script to populate the database with test data: npm run seed
        - Run the server: npm start
      ## **Usage**
        - To use the API, you will need to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) by sending a POST request to the /login endpoint with a JSON payload containing a valid email address and password. The email and password combination must match a user in the database.
        - POST /login Content-Type: application/json { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "password" }
        - The server will respond with a JWT in the Authorization header of the response. You can then include this JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to the API to authenticate yourself.
      ## **Sending Requests**
        - POST /loans: create a new loan application. The request body should include the loan application data in JSON format.
        - GET /loans: get a list of all loan applications. This endpoint requires the admin role.
        - GET /loans/ðŸ†” get a specific loan application by ID. This endpoint requires the admin or lender role.
        - PUT /loans/ðŸ†” update a specific loan application by ID. The request body should include the updated loan application data in JSON format. This endpoint requires the admin or lender role.
        - DELETE /loans/ðŸ†” delete a specific loan application by ID. This endpoint requires the `admin

## Usage
Once the environment is setup and you run the program on the IDE of your choice (Recommend IntelliJ is it was the native IDE for this project), go to BankingApplication and run the application from the main method. Postman can be used for verification purposes, to confirm that the backend is running properly before the frontend of the application is launched.
